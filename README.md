Final Project - Voice Recognition in Machine Learning via Nintendo Switch App and Custom Pokemon Battle Simulator

# Voice Recognition in Gaming
### Data Science Final Project
* Andrew Sooklall
* Mikey Esteban
* Pratik Pathak
* Zane Lynch

## Goal:  
* Facilitate accessibility to games using voice recognition for individuals or situations where using hands for a controller is improbable/impossible.
* Creating a game that uses voice recognition for all commands and activities, providing a seamless realistic scenario for entities like Pokémon.

## Tasks:
* Collect voice data for game movements and tasks.
* Design and train a model to recognize voice data and predict outputs for voice inputs.
* Create an app that connects to Nintendo switch via USB and allows the user to utilize voice inputs to control the game.
* Design a custom Pokémon battle game for player vs player battle
* Use the voice model as a base for developing a further model that recognizes battle moves and interface commands for a custom game.
* Test the new model with all related commands for the custom game.
* Create a game app that runs the game with voice input as game commands
* Create a campaign mode for the game and train the model for the new data
* Create a GUI for the game (instead of terminal based)

## Deliverable:
* Create a Nintendo switch voice recognition app
    * Collecting voice data
    * Training a model for control input recognition via voice.
    * Testing the model and predicting outputs based on voice inputs.
    * Creating an app that lets you play Nintendo switch games using voice inputs
    * Testing the model with at least one game as proof of concept
